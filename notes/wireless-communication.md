# Wireless Communication Notes

A summarized guide to key wireless communication technologies for cybersecurity and general IT knowledge.

---

## NFC (Near Field Communication)
- **Concept**: Short-range wireless communication technology (typically within 4 cm). Used for contactless payments, smart cards, and device pairing.
- **Security Risks**: Eavesdropping, relay attacks (extending communication range maliciously), data modification by attackers.
- **Real-world Uses**: Mobile payments (Google Pay, Apple Pay), access cards (offices, transportation), quick device pairing.

---

## Bluetooth
- **Concept**: Medium-range wireless communication (up to 100 meters depending on device class). Used for exchanging data between devices.
- **Security Risks**: Bluejacking (unsolicited messages), Bluesnarfing (unauthorized access to device data), vulnerabilities like BlueBorne.
- **Real-world Uses**: Wireless headsets, keyboards, speakers, smartwatches, smart home devices.

---

## Wi-Fi
- **Concept**: Wireless networking technology that connects devices to the internet and each other over longer distances. Based on IEEE 802.11 standards.
- **Security Risks**: Weak password/encryption issues (e.g., WEP vulnerabilities), Evil Twin attacks (fake Wi-Fi access points), man-in-the-middle attacks on unsecured networks.
- **Real-world Uses**: Home and office networks, public Wi-Fi hotspots, smart device internet access.

## Infrared (IR)
- **Concept**: Wireless communication technology using infrared light waves. Requires line-of-sight between devices; short-range and point-to-point communication.
- **Security Risks**: Data interception if encryption is weak, replay attacks with weak protocols.
- **Real-world Uses**: Remote controls (TVs, AC units), older phone data transfer, some hospital equipment.
