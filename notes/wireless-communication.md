. NFC (Near Field Communication)
Concept:

Short-range wireless communication technology.

Operates typically within 4 cm range.

Used for contactless payments, smart cards, and device pairing.

Security Risks:

Eavesdropping if encryption is weak.

Relay attacks (extending communication range maliciously).

Data modification by attackers.

Real-world Uses:

Mobile payments (Google Pay, Apple Pay).

Access cards (offices, transportation).

Quick device pairing.

2. Bluetooth
Concept:

Medium-range wireless communication (up to 100 meters depending on device class).

Used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices.

Security Risks:

Bluejacking (unsolicited messages).

Bluesnarfing (unauthorized access to device data).

Vulnerabilities like BlueBorne.

Real-world Uses:

Wireless headsets, keyboards, speakers.

Smartwatches and fitness devices.

Smart home integration.

3. Wi-Fi
Concept:

Wireless networking technology that enables devices to connect to the Internet and each other.

Works over longer distances compared to Bluetooth and NFC.

Based on IEEE 802.11 standards.

Security Risks:

Weak password and encryption issues (e.g., WEP vulnerabilities).

Evil Twin attacks (fake Wi-Fi access points).

Man-in-the-middle attacks on unsecured networks.

Real-world Uses:

Home and office networks.

Public Wi-Fi hotspots.

Smart device internet access.

4. Infrared (IR)
Concept:

Wireless communication technology that uses infrared light waves.

Requires line-of-sight between communicating devices.

Mostly for short-range, point-to-point communication.

Security Risks:

Data interception if encryption is weak.

Replay attacks possible with weak protocols.

Real-world Uses:

Remote controls (TVs, AC units).

Older phones' data transfer methods.

Some hospital monitoring equipment.
